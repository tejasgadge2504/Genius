                    Examinations:  <br>
                    1. Exam Conducting Authority:
                    The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) administers the
                    HSC (Class 12) board exams annually. <br>
                    2. Syllabus and Paper Pattern:
                    MSBSHSE plays a pivotal role in designing the syllabus and determining the paper pattern for Class
                    12 examinations. Students are advised to follow this prescribed curriculum and familiarize
                    themselves with the question paper format. <br>
                    3. Preparation Strategy:
                    To excel in Maha HSC exams, students are encouraged to solve previous years' question papers. This
                    practice not only provides insight into the exam pattern but also aids in refining problem-solving
                    skills.  <br>
                    4. Divisional Boards:
                    The HSC and SSC Examinations are conducted across the state of Maharashtra through nine Divisional
                    Boards situated in Pune, Mumbai, Aurangabad, Nasik, Kolhapur, Amravati, Latur, Nagpur, and
                    Ratnagiri.   <br>
                    5. Passing Criteria:
                    According to Maharashtra HSC Board's qualifying mandates, students must secure a minimum of 35% or
                    above to pass the 12th board exams. This criterion encompasses both practical and theory exam
                    scores.  <br>
                    6. Supplementary Exams:
                    In the event that a student fails to achieve the minimum passing percentage, they are required to
                    appear for Maharashtra HSC Supplementary exams. These supplementary exams offer a second chance for
                    students to clear the HSC examinations.  <br>
